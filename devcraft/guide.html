        <h2 id="trialchamber"><a href="./trialchamber/">Trial Chambers: Expansion</a></h2>
        <p><b>Trial Chambers: Expansion</b> is a dungeon crawler built as an expansion to the Trial Chambers. They are a system of challenging dungeons designed to test skill and strategy.</p>
        <p>As you progress through the chambers, you face a wide variety of custom enemies, each with unique behaviors that require adaptation rather than brute force. Encounters are designed to scale in difficulty, ensuring that runs demand stronger gear and strategy.</p>
        <p>Progression in <b>Trial Chambers: Expansion</b> is heavily tied to dungeon completion. Successful runs reward your group with powerful gear, upgrades, and rare items that enhance future attempts and open new playstyles.</p>
        <p>The Trial Chambers serve as both a test and a progression path, rewarding players who are willing to push further and take calculated risks.</p>
