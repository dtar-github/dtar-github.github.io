<div>
<p><b><u>Chainstone</u></b></p>
Already in <a href="https://github.com/gnembon/fabric-carpet/releases/tag/v1.4-homebound#:~:text=added%20chainStone%2C%20with%20the%20ability%20of%20chains%20to%20stick%20to%20each%20other%2C%20and%20blocks%20that%20have%20a%20small%20but%20firm%20contact%20surface%20on%20its%20side%20(use%20%27all%27%20to%20let%20them%20stick%20to%20everything)">Carpet Mod</a>
<p><b><u>New Blocks</u></b></p>
<div>
<p><li>Pulverizer ☆</li></p>
Breaks Blocks: When powered with redstone, the Pulverizer begins breaking the block directly in front of it (in the direction it faces)<br>
Activation: Requires a redstone pulse to activate; each pulse triggers one block-breaking cycle<br>
Breaking Time: Breaks blocks at the same speed as a wooden pickaxe would<br>
Drop Behavior: Drops items as if the block were mined with a stone pickaxe<br>
Block Output: The dropped item appears in the center of the broken block's position, not in an inventory or container<br>
Durability: The Pulverizer never breaks from use<br>
Mining Limits: Can only break blocks that are mineable with a stone pickaxe<br>

<p><b><u>Better Reporting</u></b></p>
Reports would not automatically ban projects or users. Instead, they would flag content for human moderation, reducing false or unfair bans. Sharing personal info or offsite links could be allowed if users confirm their age meets a minimum threshold, possibly requiring optional verification.
<p><b><u>More effective Search Bar</u> ☆</b></p>
Scratch could add an option to sort results by relevance instead of popularity. This would help surface high-quality or more specific projects that might not be widely known. Additionally, implementing a feature to search for users directly by username or related profile info could improve navigation and community interaction.
<p><b><u>Project Age Restriction Options</u> ☆</b></p>
Scratch could implement age-based content restrictions to allow older users access to more mature or intense visual effects (simple red particles, dying sound effects, red overlay, etc.), while keeping these effects hidden or limited for younger users. This system could also suggest or highlight projects that are better suited to the user's age, enabling more engaging, age-appropriate experiences across the platform.
<p><b><u>Dark Mode</u></b></p>
(self-explanatory)
<p><b><u>Advanced Mode</u></b></p>
Scratch could have an Advanced Mode for Scratchers where they could customize framerate, quality, and more, similar to <a href="https://turbowarp.org">Turbowarp</a>'s extra settings

<div>
<p><b><u>Description Footer</u> ☆</b></p>
YouTube could introduce a video description footer feature, allowing creators to set a footer that automatically appears at the bottom of their video descriptions. This footer could be applied universally across all videos on a channel, or selectively to videos in a particular playlist. The footer could be editable, allowing for consistent updates on links or information without having to update the description of each individual video.
<p><b><u>More effective Search Bar</u> ☆</b></p>
YouTube could add an option to sort results by relevance instead of popularity. This would help surface high-quality or more specific videos that might not be widely known. Additionally, implementing a feature to search for users directly by name or related profile info could improve navigation and community interaction.
<p><b><u>User Tags</u> ☆</b></p>
YouTube could add tags users can add to their channel to specify what they do, helping viewers easily discover other creators who produce similar content and have similar interests. These channel tags would be distinct from video tags and would provide a better categorization of the channel's focus.
